# G4mespeed Releases
Up to date releases for the G4mespeed Mods.

Click and download the mod that you wish to install. Remember that all extensions to G4mespeed require the core version to run properly.

Do not redistribute any of the JAR files in this repository.

## G4mespeed Core
The core of G4mespeed Mods, adding support for extensions through the g4mespeed-core API. The core version of g4mespeed is also itself an extension, which improves reliability of timing for client-server communication fixing many client timing-related issues. This means that you can get almost full reliability with falling blocks, pistons, elevators and much much more. Most features are client-sided (such as synchronization and monitoring tps performance of the server) but it will improve the reliability even more if the mod is also installed on the server. Note that this API is obfuscated and only intended for use with g4mespeed mods.

## G4mespeed Server Utilities
Adds various utilities that can be used when playing on dedicated servers. E.g. allows you to use certain features that the vanilla client does not, because it thinks you lack permission to do so. A good example of this is the F3 + N and F3 + F4 key combinations that are disallowed because the player is not OP. With server utilities you'll be able to use these combinations if you have access to the /gamemode command. This is currently the only feature of this extension, but as time goes on more might follow.
